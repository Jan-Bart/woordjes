# Woordjes #
With this little program, written in Java, it's possible to practice your vocabulary (i.e. foreign languages).

## History of Woordjes ##
Well, last year we had an assignment for one of our courses to learn a lot of French words. It was a hell of a job but to make it somewhat fun I created a little program to let me practice those words.

And it worked. So now, I want to share and improve this little program to all fellows out there studying words.

Good luck!

( _In Belgium, were we are from, they speak three official languages: Dutch, French and German. They expect every Belgian to know at least two of them._ )
